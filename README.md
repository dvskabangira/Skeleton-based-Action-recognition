# Skeleton-based-Action-recognition
Recognizing challenging behavioral activities from videos sequences or still images can be so challenging due
to background noise, partial occlusion, changes in scale, viewpoint, lighting and appearance. 
In this project, we use a skeleton-based hybrid approach of pose estimates and Conv3D for action recognition
